      <h3>Thank you for checking out my work. If you would like to connect I can be reached at tygesjohnson@gmail.com.
        My purpose in writing software is to use technology to solve problems.
        Throughout my career I have worked in the supply chain management, ecommerce, and medical industries.
        Each position in each different industry constantly reminded me of how important technology, data & analytics, and automation are.
        These reminders are what pushed me into the software development industry. What has kept me here is my passion to continue learning everyday,
        I find satisfaction in solving complex issues and enjoy the challenges and opportunities they afford.
      </h3>
